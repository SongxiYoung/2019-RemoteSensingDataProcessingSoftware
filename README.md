# 2019-RemoteSensingDataProcessingSoftware

This coursework used Qt and Python to design a remote sensing data processing software, including the user interface.

FILE DESCRIPTION:

RSPro.py:

Class RSImgPro is a subclass of QMainWindow. Object img is used to store the image matrix of the current window, with all processing operations using this member, ensuring that the image can be repeatedly processed.

equalHist.py:
Histogram equalization is essentially a nonlinear stretching of the image, redistributing the image pixel values so that the number of pixel values in a certain gray scale range is approximately equal.
